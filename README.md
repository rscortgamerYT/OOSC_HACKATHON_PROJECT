# üö® SOS Alert App

A simple emergency SOS application that allows users to quickly notify their emergency contacts in case of danger. The app automatically sends an SOS alert with location details and requests confirmation from the contacts whether they are responding. If one contact cannot respond, the system automatically escalates to other contacts.
